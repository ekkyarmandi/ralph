# Progress Log: user-default-group

Created: 2026-01-16 10:28:43

## Stories Completed
1. **1.1 - Add create_default_group method to SQLRepository** ✓
   - Implemented `create_default_group(user: User) -> Group` in `shared/data/sql_repository.py`
   - Creates Group with name "Default Group" and description "Your personal default group for expenses"
   - Adds user as admin member via GroupMember entry
   - Sets user.default_group_id and commits transaction
   - Includes proper error handling with rollback on failure

2. **1.2 - Add create_default_group wrapper to DataRepository** ✓
   - Added wrapper method in `shared/data/repository.py` that delegates to `self.store.create_default_group(user)`
   - Maintains abstraction layer pattern

3. **1.3 - Integrate create_default_group into user registration flow** ✓
    - Modified `register_user()` in `shared/core/expense_tracker.py`
    - Now calls `self.repository.create_default_group(added_user)` after adding the user
    - New users automatically get default group during registration

4. **2.1 - Verify API routes support default group operations** ✓
    - Reviewed `api/routes/groups.py` to verify API support for default group
    - GET /api/v1/groups endpoint: Lists all groups via GroupMember query
      - Default group created in 1.1 adds user as member
      - Default group automatically appears in list - no code changes needed
    - PUT /api/v1/groups/{group_id} endpoint: Updates group details
      - Checks admin access via check_admin_access() function
      - User is set as admin of default group in story 1.1
      - Name and description updates work for default group without special handling
    - Conclusion: Existing routes already support default groups fully
    - No code modifications required

## Key Decisions
- Used `db.flush()` before `db.commit()` to get group ID without premature commit
- Set user.default_group_id within the same transaction for atomicity
- Added role="admin" for user in default group to enable full permissions
- Comprehensive error handling with rollback ensures transaction consistency
- API routes need no modifications - default group treated as regular group at API level

## Files Modified
- `shared/data/sql_repository.py` - Added create_default_group method with full implementation
- `shared/data/repository.py` - Added wrapper method
- `shared/core/expense_tracker.py` - Integrated into register_user() flow
- `api/routes/groups.py` - Verified working with default groups (no changes needed)

5. **2.2 - Verify frontend Groups page displays default group** ✓
   - Reviewed frontend Group types and components in `app/src/types/group.ts` and `app/src/pages/Groups.tsx`
   - Verified Group interface includes all necessary fields for display
   - Confirmed fetchGroups() API call returns default group created in story 1.1
   - Verified Groups list view displays all groups including default group in grid layout
   - Verified Groups detail view accessible by clicking group card
   - Confirmed edit functionality available for admin users (user is admin of default group)
   - Edit dialog allows changing name and description via PUT endpoint
   - Conclusion: Frontend works without modifications - default group displays and edits work correctly
   - No frontend code changes needed - uses existing group display and edit mechanisms

6. **3.1 - Add visual indicator for default group** ✓
   - Added Star icon import from lucide-react
   - Modified group list card header to display amber badge with star icon next to default group name
   - Added similar badge in detail view header for consistency
   - Badge displays "Default" label with filled star icon
   - Styled with amber-100 background and amber-700 text to match design system
   - Indicator appears both in groups list grid view and group detail view
   - No new files created, only UI enhancements to existing component

7. **3.2 - Prevent deletion of user's default group** ✓
   - Added validation check in `delete_group()` function in `api/routes/groups.py`
   - Check prevents deletion if group_id matches current_user.default_group_id
   - Returns HTTP 400 error with message: "Cannot delete your default group. Set another group as default first."
   - Error message guides user to change their default group before deletion
   - Protection applied before any deletion operations (early return pattern)
   - Existing logic for clearing default_group_id remains for other users' scenarios

## Key Implementation Details
- Validation added immediately after admin access check but before group retrieval operations
- Uses existing User.default_group_id relationship field
- Error code: HTTP 400 BAD_REQUEST (appropriate for business logic constraint)
- Prevents accidental data loss from user error
- Allows deletion once user changes their default group to another one

## Files Modified
- `api/routes/groups.py` - Added deletion prevention logic in delete_group() endpoint
