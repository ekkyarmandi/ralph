I've successfully completed story 3.1 (and incidentally 4.1 which was part of the same implementation). Here's a summary:

## Summary

**Story 3.1: Refactor luma-event-form to sequential flow layout** - COMPLETE

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed the 2-column grid layout** - The old layout had `grid-cols-5` with `col-span-2` (connection) and `col-span-3` (event selection) side by side

2. **Implemented sequential flow based on connection state**:
   - **When NOT connected**: Full-width centered card with:
     - Fluar <-> Luma logo header
     - "Connect Luma" title and description
     - API key input field
     - Connection name input field
     - Help links (Get API Key, Documentation)
     - Connect button
   
   - **When connected**: Full-width form with:
     - "Select your event" header
     - Event dropdown with search
     - Event preview image in trigger when selected (this also satisfied story 4.1)
     - Enrichment options
     - Create Project button

3. **Embedded connection logic directly in component** - Removed dependency on `IntegrationConnectDialog` and `IntegrationConnectInline` components, using `useIntegration`'s `saveConnection` mutation directly

### Files Modified:
- `apps/web/src/components/project/create/components/luma-event-form.tsx`

### Status:
- Typecheck passes (the only error is pre-existing in `table-header.tsx`)
- Changes committed and pushed to `feat/luma` branch
