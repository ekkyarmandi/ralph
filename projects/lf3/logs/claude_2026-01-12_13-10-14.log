Story 2.1 is complete. Here's what was implemented:

**Story 2.1 - Add paste handler for Luma API key validation**

Changes made to `apps/web/src/components/integrations/integration-connect-dialog.tsx`:

1. **Added imports**: `ClipboardEvent` type and `useCallback` hook
2. **Extracted `validateApiKey` function**: Common validation logic wrapped in `useCallback` that handles:
   - Checking if integration is Luma
   - Validating key length (>= 8 chars)
   - Setting validation state
   - Calling the API mutation
   - Auto-populating connection name on success
3. **Added `handleApiKeyPaste` function**: Handles paste events by extracting pasted text, trimming it, and triggering validation if >= 8 chars
4. **Added `onPaste` handler to Input**: Connected the paste handler to the API key input field

The existing `handleApiKeyBlur` was simplified to use the new `validateApiKey` function.
